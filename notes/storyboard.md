# Describe Neurons

https://www.verywell.com/what-is-a-neuron-2794890

**Neuron**s are nerve cells in the brain that can **process and transmit information**.

Neurons are connected to one another by **axon**s.

Neurons "*process*" information by **recognizing patterns**.

Neurons "*transmit*" that information by **sending signals down axons**.

We move on to show a practical example of how that happens.

## How do neurons transmit information?

In Machine Learning, each neuron is programmed to recognize one pattern.

Have a diagram to show the 3 strokes for letter 'A'.

Diagram has 3 neurons in layer 1, and 2 neurons in layer 2.

Quizz: What other shapes can those 3 strokes combine into?
