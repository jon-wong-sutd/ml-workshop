## Rationale for the course

Security by design does not only apply to technology but also to the socio-economic context of technology. For example choice architecture is a design method that influences the way in which people make decisions, and CPTED (Crime prevention through Environmental Design) aims specifically at reducing crime. There is evidence that these methods can be used in cyber space as well as “meat” space.
